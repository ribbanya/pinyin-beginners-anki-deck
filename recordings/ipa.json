    "extract": "The open front unrounded vowel, or low front unrounded vowel, is a type of vowel sound, used in some spoken languages. It is one of the eight primary cardinal vowels, not directly intended to correspond to a vowel sound of a specific language but rather to serve as a fundamental reference point in a phonetic measuring system.The symbol in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) that represents this sound is \u27e8a\u27e9, and in the IPA vowel chart it is positioned at the lower-left corner. However, the accuracy of the quadrilateral vowel chart is disputed, and the sound has been analyzed acoustically as extra-open at a position where the front/back distinction has lost its significance. There are also differing interpretations of the exact quality of the vowel: the classic sound recording of [a] by Daniel Jones is slightly more front but not quite as open as that by John Wells.In practice, it is considered normal by many phoneticians to use the symbol \u27e8a\u27e9 for an open central unrounded vowel and instead approximate the open front unrounded vowel with \u27e8\u00e6\u27e9 (which officially signifies a near-open front unrounded vowel). This is the usual practice, for example, in the historical study of the English language. The loss of separate symbols for open and near-open front vowels is usually considered unproblematic, because the perceptual difference between the two is quite small, and very few languages contrast the two. If there is a need to specify the backness of the vowel as fully front one can use the symbol \u27e8\u00e6\u031e\u27e9, which denotes a lowered near-open front unrounded vowel.\nThe Hamont-Achel dialect of Limburgish has been reported to contrast long open front, central and back unrounded vowels.

There are some languages (e.g. Rotokas) that lack both [m] and [n].\nTrue dental consonants are relatively uncommon. In the Romance, Dravidian, and Australian languages, n is often called \"dental\" in the literature. However, the rearmost contact (which is what gives a consonant its distinctive sound) is actually alveolar or denti-alveolar. The difference between the Romance languages and English is not so much where the tongue contacts the roof of the mouth, as which part of the tongue makes the contact. In English it is the tip of the tongue (such sounds are termed apical), whereas in the Romance languages it is the flat of the tongue just above the tip (such sounds are called laminal).\nHowever, there are languages with true apical (or less commonly laminal) dental n. It is found in the Mapuche language of South America, where it is actually interdental. A true dental generally occurs allophonically before /\u03b8/ in languages which have it, as in English tenth. Similarly, a denti-alveolar allophone will occur in languages which have denti-alveolar stops, as in Spanish cinta.\nSome languages contrast laminal denti-alveolar and apical alveolar nasals.

It also represents the symbol, which can be remembered as an o which has been \"opened\" by removing part of the closed circular shape.\nIn English, the symbol \u27e8\u0254\u27e9 (or \u27e8\u0254\u02d0\u27e9) is typically associated with the vowel in \"thought\", but in Received Pronunciation (standard British English), Australian English, New Zealand English and South African English that vowel is produced with considerably stronger lip rounding and higher tongue position than that of cardinal [\u0254], i.e. as close-mid [o\u02d0] or somewhat lower. Open-mid [\u0254\u02d0] or even open [\u0252\u02d0] realizations are found in North American English (where this vowel is often indistinguishable from the open back unrounded vowel in \"bra\") and Scottish English as well as Hiberno-English, Northern England English and Welsh English, though in the last three accent groups closer, [o\u02d0]-like realizations are also found. In RP, the open-mid realization of /\u0254\u02d0/ has been obsolete since the 1930s. Pronouncing that vowel as such is subject to correction for non-native speakers aiming at RP.In Received Pronunciation and Australian English, the open-mid back rounded vowel occurs as the main allophone of the LOT vowel /\u0252/. The contrast between /\u0254\u02d0/ and /\u0252/ is thus strongly maintained, with the former vowel being realized as close-mid [o\u02d0] and the latter as open-mid [\u0254], similarly to the contrast between /o/ and /\u0254/ found in German, Italian and Portuguese.",

The symbol in the International Phonetic Alphabet that represents this sound is \u27e8\u0255\u27e9 (\"c\", plus the curl also found in its voiced counterpart \u27e8\u0291\u27e9). It is the sibilant equivalent of the voiceless palatal fricative, and as such it can be transcribed in IPA with \u27e8\u00e7\u02d6\u27e9.\nIn British Received Pronunciation, /j/ after syllable-initial /p, t, k/ (as in Tuesday) is realized as a devoiced palatal fricative. The amount of devoicing is variable, but the fully voiceless variant tends to be alveolo-palatal [\u0255] in the /tj/ sequence: [\u02c8t\u033a\u02b2\u0255u\u02d0zde\u026a]. It is a fricative, rather than a fricative element of an affricate because the preceding plosive remains alveolar, rather than becoming alveolo-palatal, as in Dutch.The corresponding affricate can be written with \u27e8t\u0320\u02b2\u0361\u0255\u27e9 or \u27e8c\u031f\u0361\u0255\u27e9 in narrow IPA, though \u27e8t\u0255\u27e9 is normally used in both cases. In the case of English, the sequence can be specified as \u27e8t\u033a\u0255\u27e9 as /t/ is normally apical (although somewhat palatalized in that sequence), whereas alveolo-palatal consonants are laminal by definition.An increasing number of British speakers merge this sequence with the voiceless palato-alveolar affricate /t\u0283/: [\u02c8t\u0283u\u02d0zde\u026a] (see yod-coalescence), mirroring Cockney, Australian English and New Zealand English. On the other hand, there is an opposite tendency in Canadian accents that have preserved /tj/, where the sequence tends to merge with the plain /t/ instead: [\u02c8t\u033a\u02b0u\u02d0zde\u026a] (see yod-dropping), mirroring General American which does not allow /j/ to follow alveolar consonants in stressed syllables.",

The symbol in the International Phonetic Alphabet that represents this sound is \u27e8\u0259\u27e9, a rotated lowercase letter e.\nWhile the Handbook of the International Phonetic Association does not define the roundedness of [\u0259], it is more often unrounded than rounded. The phonetician Jane Setter describes the pronunciation of the unrounded variant as follows: \"[\u0259] is a sound which can be produced by basically relaxing the articulators in the oral cavity and vocalising.\" To produce the rounded variant, all that needs to be done in addition to that is to round the lips.\nAfrikaans contrasts unrounded and rounded mid central vowels; the latter is usually transcribed with \u27e8\u0153\u27e9. The contrast is not very stable, and many speakers use an unrounded vowel in both cases.Danish and Luxembourgish, have a mid central vowel that is variably rounded. In other languages, the change in rounding is accompanied with the change in height and/or backness. For instance, in Dutch, the unrounded allophone of /\u0259/ is mid central unrounded [\u0259], but its word-final rounded allophone is close-mid front rounded [\u00f8\u031c], close to the main allophone of /\u028f/.The symbol \u27e8\u0259\u27e9 is often used for any unstressed obscure vowel, regardless of its precise quality.
